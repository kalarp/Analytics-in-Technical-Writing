# Hemingway Editor

Another tool you can use to improve the readability of your documentation is the Hemingway Editor, named after Ernest Hemingway, who advocated short sentences and direct writing. The tool focuses on improving style and clarity, and is available as a website or a desktop application.

The free version offers several useful features:

* Readability analysis based on a grade level, helping you understand how easy your content is to read.
* Colour-coded highlights that indicate the areas for improvement:
   * Blue: adverbs and weak words.
   * Green: grammar and spelling (premium).
   * Purple: complex words or phrases that can be simplified.
   * Yellow: sentences that are hard to read.
   * Red: sentences that are very hard to read.
* Suggestions for simpler word choices when complex words are used. 

You can upgrade the free version to the paid Hemingway Editor Plus. It offers additional features such as:

* Sentence rewriting with the use of AI.
* Advanced grammar checking.
* Synonym suggestions to enrich your writing. 
* Tone and style adjustments to suit different audiences.
