# DeepL

If you need a straightforward AI-powered translator and writing assistant, DeepL is worth considering. DeepL uses Neural Machine Translation (NMT) technology to deliver high-quality translations that capture the nuances and context of the original text. It has a built-in writing assistant that analyses entire sentences, makes corrections and offers suggestions to improve clarity, style and accuracy. The paid version is a good choice for professional use as it offers advanced data security and removes the character limit. You can access the assistant via the website, a downloadable desktop or mobile app, and a browser extension.

For the purpose of this project, we will focus solely on the DeepL writing assistant.

## How To Check Your Text Using DeepL

1. Go to the [**DeepL Write**](https://www.deepl.com/en/write) assisstant website.
2. You can select the source language from the language selection list, although DeepL will automatically recognise the language if it is supported.
