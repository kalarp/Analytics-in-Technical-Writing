# Readable

Readable is an online tool designed to help you check and improve the quality of your content. It analyses text using a range of metrics to ensure it is understandable to your intended audience:

* Readability scores based on formulas such as the Flesch-Kincaid Readability Score, Gunning Fog Index, SMOG Index and more.
* Tone, sentiment and personalism analysis. 
* Reach metrics, which estimate the percentage of your audience likely to understand your text. 
* Keyword density assessment to help you avoid overusing certain terms.
* Text analysis, including identification of passive voice and complex sentences.

The free version offers limited functionality, allowing you to familiarise yourself with the tool. Upgrading to the Pro version provides access to the full range of features.
